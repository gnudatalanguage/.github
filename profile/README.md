GDL - GNU Data Language
=======================

GDL is a free/libre/open source incremental compiler compatible with IDL (Interactive Data Language) and to some extent with PV-WAVE. 
Together with its library routines it serves as a tool for data analysis and visualization in such disciplines 
as astronomy, geosciences and medical imaging. 
GDL development had been started by **Marc Schellens** back in early noughties and has since continued 
with help of a team of maintainers, developers, packagers and thanks to feedback from users.

IDL is a registered trademark of [Harris Geospatial Solutions](https://www.harrisgeospatial.com).
PV-WAVE is a product of [Rogue Wave Software](https://www.roguewave.com).
